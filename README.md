# HR-Analytics-Power-BI-Dashboard:-

This GitHub repository contains a Power BI dashboard for HR analytics, designed to provide insights into employee data and help businesses make data-driven decisions. The dashboard includes a variety of key performance indicators (KPIs), such as overall employees, attrition count, attrition rate, active employees, and average age of employees.

To create the dashboard, I used various Power BI visualizations, such as pie charts for department-wise attrition, stacked bar charts for the number of employees by age, matrix charts for job satisfaction ratings, clustered bar charts for education fields of employees, and donut charts for attrition rates by gender for different age groups. These visualizations were chosen to provide an intuitive and interactive way to analyze employee data, and to enable users to quickly identify trends and patterns.

By using this dashboard, businesses can gain a better understanding of their workforce, identify areas that require improvement, and make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention and satisfaction. Additionally, the Power BI dashboard provides a centralized location for HR analytics data, making it easier to access and analyze data from various sources.

Overall, this HR analytics Power BI dashboard is a valuable tool for businesses looking to improve their HR processes and make more informed decisions based on employee data. The dashboard is customizable and can be adapted to fit the specific needs of individual businesses.
